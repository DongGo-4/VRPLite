The goal of this package includes the following three aspects.
(1)	Provide an open-source code base that enables transportation researchers and software developers to expand its range of capabilities to various traffic/transportation management applications.
(2)	Provide a free, educational modeling framework for students and researchers to understand the complex space-time-state network modeling process for transportation optimization applications, e.g. train timetabling, urban rail transit scheduling and ride-sharing applications.
(3)	We introduce our solution approach and related software implementation from a time-dependent and state-dependent shortest path approach.
